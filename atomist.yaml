    Automatically rebase a pull request branch if there are pushes to the base branch
  documentation: |-
    Automatically rebase a pull request branch if there are pushes to the base branch. 
    Keep pull request branches current with the base branch to identify merge issues and 
    avoid a surprise when you go to merge. You don't have to think about your pull request 
    branches any more — this skill keeps them in harmony with the base branch.
